        <h1>About me</h1>
        <img src="Pictures/logo_homepage.png" alt="Logo Portrait" class="about_page_photo">
        <p>My name is Tom Edwards and I am aspiring to be a data scientist. 
           I completed a Bachelor's degree in Science where I majored in Statistics as well as a Graduate certificate
           in data science. I have developed the right skills and knowledge to be a great asset to any data team. The 
           one thing I love the most about data science and analystics is 
           the multiple ways you can uncover the root causes of problems with data. I have recently been teaching
           myself about machine learning and have multiple skill in R, Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau and PowerBI 
           which I hope are shown well through the various projects I have uploaded.
        </p>
        <p>One other aspect
            of data science that I really like is the creative and descriptive side of it. Creating reports and dashboards 
            is a great way to express yourself, the company and most importantly the data and is a great creative outlet
            for a numbers based job.  
        </p>
       

        <p> A lot of these projects that have been initially uploaded are sports centric. Other than data science, sport is 
            one of my great passions. I have done research on a couple of things in Fantasy Premier League as well as some
            analysis of AFL teams at different grounds. My two teams in the Premier League and the AFL are Newcastle United
            and Collingwood Magpies, respectively.
